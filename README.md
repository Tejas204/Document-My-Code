# Document-My-Code

## Initial concept
This repository contains the code for a VS code extension that helps you generate documentation for your code, thus saving you valuable time.

## MVP
An extension, using Gemini/ChatGPT or other AI tools to document your code in a presentable format

## Proposed Features
1. Document code opened in current file
2. Document code in the entire directory
3. Download a word or PDF file for the documentation
